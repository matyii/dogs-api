Send pictures of random dogs through Discord Webhooks!

### Information
This is just an edited version of my [chucknorris-jokes](https://github.com/matyii/chucknorris-jokes) repository!

### Installation
- Install the requirements by using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Fill in your Discord Webhook URL in the `webhook_url` field
- Run the code, and customize it to your use case!

### Using multiple URLs
If you want to use multiple webhooks, simply just delete or comment line 5 (`webhook_url = "URL"`), and uncomment line 6 (`webhook_url = ['url', 'url2']`)
